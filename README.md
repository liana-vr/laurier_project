# Laurier

Laurier is an e-commerce B2C web application I designed and built with the Luxury Goods Consumer in mind. I created a multi-project solution using 
                        **ASP.Net Core** and a single-page client app using **Angular** and **TypeScript**. 
                        I used **Stripe** for payment processing and **Redis** for storing the shopping cart. For data persistence I used two separate **PotgreSQL** databases; 
                        one for user identity and the other for product data. Laurier was deployed using **Docker, Linux** and **Digital Ocean** and I used GitHub for version control.</p>
                    This Project followed the **Specification Pattern** and the **Repository + Unit of Work Pattern**.</p>
